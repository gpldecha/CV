\opening{Dear Mrs./Mr.,} 


%it's ok but right now it doesn't look like you spent much time writing it.
%Just in case you didn't notice, the first paragraph is repeated. The official name of the project is SecondHands, 
%written together with capital S, H. In the third paragraph, I don't know what you mean by "the hart of acting under uncertainty", is it art/heart??

%I think you should structure a bit more your skills.

% (1) Say first that you are an expert in mathematical modelling,  machine learning and robotics. 

% (2) Then you talk about you thesis "The essence of my Ph.D thesis lies at the heart? 
%     of acting under uncertainty which will be a valuable skill to contribute to the project." And then you highlight 
%     your experience with many of the numerous robots from LASA, for example with the LWR + F/T sensor.


% (3) They will like you, because they have to integrate the setup and the code from LASA at Ocado, 
%     and you would be perfect for helping there at the beginning and immediately.

%     Best,
%     jose


I am a Swiss-British national and I have recently obtained my Ph.D doctorate in robotics from
EPFL in the LASA robotics lab which happens to also be a partner in the SecondHands
European project. I was made aware of your vacancy from the robotics-worldwide message
group.

% Say that I am an expert in machine learning methods and mathematical modeling

I am an expert in Machine Learning (ML), mathematical modelling and robotics. I have 
been teaching two  machine learning classes at EPFL for both MSc and Ph.Ds. I have supervised 
students and published novel machine learning methods in reinforcement learning and non-parametric Bayesian 
state space estimation with an emphasis on robotic applications. 
I am continuously implementing, testing and deploying ML methods as it is also a hobby of mine (see 
\href{http://chambrierg.com/projects/np_regression/}{non-parametric regression} and \href{http://chambrierg.com/projects/e-pca/}{E-PCA} 
for examples ML software packages I developed).

The essence of my Ph.D thesis lies at the heart of acting under uncertainty which will 
be a valuable skill to contribute to the SecondHands project and to Ocado in general. For instance I developed a ROS package 
for an ATI force-torque sensor and a KUKA LWR robot (see \href{https://github.com/epfl-lasa/kuka-lwr-ros}{kuka-lwr-ros}). 
I used these platforms (currently being used by SecondHands members) to teach the KUKA, in a programming by demonstration framework, to search for and 
connect an electric power socket without using any visual information (see \href{http://chambrierg.com/projects/rl_belief_space/}{Reinforcement learning in belief space}). 
I have also experience with other robotic platforms, besides the KUKA LWR, such as Barrett WAM, Barrett Hand and Allegro Hand.  

I am very experienced in robotic software development (ROS, ros\_control, moveit) and have developed numerous Â¨
software packages during my Ph.D. I am a daily C++/Python user and I predominately work with 
Linux operation systems.  In terms of libraries, I have worked with and added a new distance metric 
to the KDTree of point cloud library.  You may contact Jos\'{e} Ram\'{o}n Medina who is currently working on 
the SecondHands project and is using the software I developed.



Beyond SecondHands, I am looking to be part of an ambitious robotic company looking to 
acquire a global presence.  The increasing investment by Ocado in robotic systems whilst 
recognising the importance of human-robot collaboration makes it an ideal environment 
for me to contribute to. I am looking forward to the possibility of being part of 
Ocado in which I seek to contribute to the development and increase of its robotic 
section.

I will be moving to London at the start of next year, but I will be at your disposition at any
time for an interview. You can also visit my personal web-page: \href{www.chambrierg.com}{chambrierg.com}

\closing{Sincerely yours,}
