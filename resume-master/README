This is my resume (and CV) in LaTeX

I am not currently looking for work, but if you are then check out http://yelp.com/careers and shoot me an email with your resume at sclark@yelp.com and I'll put you in our system.

This resume is based off a template I found a few years ago, which was a modified template, see the (C) list at the top for a history.

I have also included the original templates (along the path to my resume).

Feel free to fork and edit.

In linux a simple
$ pdflatex resumeName.tex
should kick out a resumeName.pdf
